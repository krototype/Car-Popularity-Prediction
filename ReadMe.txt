To preprocess the data open data_preprocess.py , this will help in finding all kind of plots , finding the number of null values , and feature engineering.

For finding the model that would fit this dataset and produce the output csv file go to model_fit.py and run it.
The output csv file will be generated in the folder where model_fit.py is present.

Output - Prediction is the file which contains the output which was submitted.
